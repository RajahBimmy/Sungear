/**
 * Represents a term in the GO hierarchy.  This class is a little more complicated
 * than one might expect because of the set operations required to support the
 * effecient calculation of z-scores and selection.  Support functions provide
 * recursive set union and intersection size operations.
 *
 * Essentially, {@link #initUnion()} and {@link #findUnion(SortedSet)} are called
 * whenever a new experiment is loaded to update {@link #allGenes}.  From this point
 * on, the number of genes at this node and its descendents can be found by the
 * intersection of {@link #allGenes} with the current selected or active set as
 * appropriate.
 *
 * {@link #storedCount}, which is returned by {@link #getStoredCount()},
 * is an optimization for the calculation of Hypergeometric-Distribution.  Although
 * it's called the stored count, it's only used to represent the size of the intersection
 * of {@link #allGenes} with the active set.  This count is used for the Instantiation of
 * HypergeometricDistribution class after Narrow operations, and determining the fraction
 * of genes selected for this term.
 * This value is recalculated every time a narrow is performed, using the
 * functions {@link #resetStoredCount()} and {@link #updateStoredCount(SortedSet)}.  This
 * much more efficient than determining the intersection size dynamically each time it is
 * needed, primarily because the option to sort by Hyper-Geo Distribution is provided in the interface,
 * which requires that all the probabilities be available after a narrow for the sorting
 * procedure.
 *
 * {@link #getIntersectCount(SortedSet)} is the dynamic version of {@link #getStoredCount()}
 * in that it dynamically determines the size of the intersection set.  It is intended for
 * use on very small sets of terms, such as will fit on one screen in a list component.
 *
 * {@link #selectedState}, which is returned by {@link #getSelectedState()}, is
 * a more effecient way to see if a term (or any of its children) has genes in the
 * selected set.  It is recalculated by calling {@link #initSelectedState()} and
 * {@link #updateSelectedState(SortedSet)}, which is usually done by {@link gui.GoTerm}
 * when the selected set changes while the collapse GO term list option is selected.
